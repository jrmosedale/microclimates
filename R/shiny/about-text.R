              (figs 1a-c)."),
            p("Many vineyard managers and winemakers attribute much of this growth to the warmer
              growing seasons evident over the past 30 years (fig 2a). 
              Low growing season temperatures are widely seen as a key factor restricting 
              viticulture in England and other higher latitude regions. Even a slight increase 
              in mean or aggregated measures of growing season temperature can greatly improve 
              the range of grapevine cultivars that can be grown and the size and quality of harvests."),
            p("Yet vineyard yields in England and Wales fluctuate from one year to another more than
              any other comparable crop (fig 2b). Furthermore, this variability in yields is not
              simply related to variation in growing season temperature (fig 2c). Instead, vineyard
              yields are affected by a range of climate risks, including weather conditions at key
              periods of crop development; not easily captured by seasonal and regional conditions. "),
